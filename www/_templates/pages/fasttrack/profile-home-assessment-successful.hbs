            <p><i class="fa fa-check the-icon"></i>Congratulations! We're pleased to let you know you've successfully passed the Fast Track assessment.</p>
            <p>We'll match you to a role and then we'll be in touch to confirm your allocated department and location.</p>
            <p>We'll also ask you to give us the information we need to complete a pre-appointment security check. Your offer depends upon successful completion of the checks. If you give information you know is false, or you withhold any relevant information, your application may be rejected. Or, if you've already been appointed, you may be dismissed.</p>
            <p>From December 2016, after we've finished allocating placements, we can give you feedback on your performance at the assessment centre. Please contact us if you'd like feedback.</p>
            <p>We recommend you don't resign from any employment until you've received a formal offer of appointment. If you withdraw your application, it won't be possible to re-instate your application at a later date.</p>
