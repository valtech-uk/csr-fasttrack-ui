<p>Dear John</p>
<p>Your application won't be complete until you finish the online tests.</p>
<h3>You now have 3 days left to complete the tests.</h3>
<p>The tests will expire at 3:56pm on 10 April 2016. You'll no longer be able to take the tests after this date.</p>
<p>You'll need to sign in to start the tests<br> (<a href="/fasttrack/profile-signin.html?Status=testsready">https://www.apply-civil-service-apprenticeship.service.gov.uk/csr-fast-track/signin</a>)</p>
